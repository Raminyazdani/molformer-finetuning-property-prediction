Ramin Yazdani | molformer-finetuning-property-prediction | main | feat(influence): Add influence function-based data selection using LiSSA

Implemented influence_based_selection.ipynb demonstrating advanced research-level
technique for selecting high-value training samples from external datasets using influence
functions approximated via LiSSA (Linear time Stochastic Second-order Algorithm).

Notebook implements:
- LiSSA algorithm for influence function approximation
- Gradient computation for training samples
- Influence score calculation for external data points
- High-influence sample selection
- Integration with fine-tuned MolFormer from previous step

This demonstrates sophisticated ML research techniques beyond standard fine-tuning,
showcasing understanding of training dynamics and data selection strategies.

Verification: Created notebooks/influence_based_selection.ipynb with LiSSA implementation.
