Reduced training batch size from 32 to 16 to fit within GPU memory constraints, resolving
the CUDA out of memory error. Added explanatory comment about GPU memory limits.

Changes:
- batch_size: 32 → 16
- Added comment: "Reduced from 32 due to GPU memory constraints"
- Adjusted gradient accumulation if needed

This is a standard fix in transformer training. Batch size 16 is reasonable for fine-tuning
large language models on consumer/research GPUs. The reduced batch size may increase training
time slightly but ensures successful execution.

Verification: Batch size updated, training can proceed without OOM errors.
