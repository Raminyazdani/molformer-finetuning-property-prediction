Ramin Yazdani | molformer-finetuning-property-prediction | main | feat(setup): Initial commit: Project README

Created foundational README documenting the project purpose and scope for MolFormer 
fine-tuning on molecular property prediction tasks. This establishes the project's identity 
as a chemical language model fine-tuning demonstration using transfer learning techniques.

The README outlines the high-level goal: fine-tuning pre-trained MolFormer models for 
lipophilicity prediction using masked language modeling and regression objectives.

Verification: README.md created with project overview.
