Ramin Yazdani | molformer-finetuning-property-prediction | main | feat(training): Add model checkpointing and evaluation metrics

Completed the training pipeline by adding model/tokenizer saving, evaluation metrics,
and configuration files. This represents a complete working implementation of the MLM
fine-tuning approach.

Added functionality:
- Model saving to ./models/mlm_finetuned_molformer/
- Tokenizer saving to ./models/mlm_finetuned_tokenizer/
- Evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²)
- Predictions saved to ./outputs/predictions.csv
- Model configuration files (config.json)

The training notebook is now a complete end-to-end pipeline from data loading to trained
model output. This milestone delivers the first major project component.

Verification: Model saving implemented, predictions generated, config files created.
