Ramin Yazdani | molformer-finetuning-property-prediction | main | feat(setup): Add .gitignore for Python project

Configured version control to exclude Python artifacts and generated files including
bytecode, virtual environments, Jupyter checkpoints, IDE configurations, and output files.

This prevents committing:
- Python bytecode (*.pyc, __pycache__)
- Virtual environments (.venv, venv)
- Jupyter checkpoints (.ipynb_checkpoints)
- IDE files (.vscode, .idea)
- Data and model files (handled separately)

Verification: .gitignore created with comprehensive Python patterns.
