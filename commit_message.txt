Ramin Yazdani | molformer-finetuning-property-prediction | main | feat(structure): Create organized directory structure for ML project

Established professional directory structure for the machine learning project with clear
separation of concerns:
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for experiments and demonstrations
- models/: Trained model checkpoints and tokenizers
- data/: Dataset storage (with .gitkeep for tracking)
- outputs/: Predictions and results (with .gitkeep for tracking)

This organization follows ML project best practices and improves code maintainability.
Empty directories include .gitkeep files to ensure they're tracked in version control.

Verification: Created 4 directories, added 2 .gitkeep files.
