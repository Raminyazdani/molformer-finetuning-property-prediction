Ramin Yazdani | molformer-finetuning-property-prediction | main | WIP(training): Document model save path issue

During code review of the training notebook, noticed a typo in the model save path:
'mlm_finetuend_molformer' instead of 'mlm_finetuned_molformer' (missing 't' in 'finetuned').

Added a "Known Issues" section to README documenting this typo that needs fixing. This
path would cause FileNotFoundError when attempting to save or load the trained model.

This is a realistic scenario: fast typing or copy-paste errors during rapid development.
The issue was caught during visual code review before executing the training, preventing
a runtime failure.

Verification: README.md updated with known issues section noting the typo.
