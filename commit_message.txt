Ramin Yazdani | molformer-finetuning-property-prediction | main | feat(docs): Add installation and setup instructions to README

Added comprehensive setup section with prerequisites, installation steps, and usage
guidance for both Windows and Linux environments. This makes the project immediately
usable for new contributors or users.

Setup instructions include:
- Python version requirements (3.8+)
- Virtual environment creation
- Dependency installation from requirements.txt
- GPU/CUDA setup notes
- Notebook execution order

Making the project accessible is critical for portfolio presentation and open-source
collaboration.

Verification: README.md enhanced with setup instructions.
