During testing after the bulk path refactoring, realized there might be remaining absolute
paths in the influence notebook that were missed during the find-and-replace operation.

Added TODO comment to check the influence_based_selection.ipynb thoroughly for any paths
that were not caught in the bulk refactoring. This is a realistic scenario: bulk changes
often miss edge cases that have slightly different formats or contexts.

Manual code review and testing after automated refactoring is best practice for catching
these types of issues.

Verification: TODO comment added for manual review.
