Created mlm_regression_training.ipynb with foundational imports and data loading logic
for the Lipophilicity dataset from MoleculeNet. This establishes the data pipeline before
adding model complexity.

Notebook includes:
- Library imports (torch, transformers, datasets, pandas)
- HuggingFace datasets loading
- Data exploration and validation
- Train/test split preparation

Starting with data loading allows validation of the pipeline before introducing model
training overhead. This incremental approach reduces debugging complexity.

Verification: Created notebooks/mlm_regression_training.ipynb with data pipeline.
