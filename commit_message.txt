Refactored all notebooks to use relative paths instead of absolute Google Colab paths,
making the project portable across environments. This major refactoring improves
maintainability and supports local development.

Changes across notebooks:
- Replaced all /content/drive/... absolute paths with ./models/, ./data/, ./outputs/
- Commented out drive.mount() calls with explanatory notes
- Updated .gitignore with enhanced patterns
- Verified all path references

This ensures the project works correctly on local machines, cloud VMs, or any environment,
not just Google Colab. Portability is critical for a portfolio project.

Verification: All notebooks updated, paths are relative, Colab code commented.
