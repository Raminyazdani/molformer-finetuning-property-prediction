Ramin Yazdani | molformer-finetuning-property-prediction | main | WIP(training): Add MolFormer model initialization and tokenizer setup

Extended MLM training notebook with MolFormer model and tokenizer initialization from
HuggingFace. The model is loaded in its pre-trained state, ready for fine-tuning on the
molecular property prediction task.

Added components:
- MolFormer model loading from 'ibm/MolFormer-XL-both-10pct'
- Tokenizer initialization for SMILES strings
- Model configuration for regression heads
- Device placement (GPU/CPU)

This validates the model loading pipeline before implementing the training loop, ensuring
compatibility with the dataset format and avoiding wasted training time on configuration
issues.

Verification: Notebook extended with model initialization code.
