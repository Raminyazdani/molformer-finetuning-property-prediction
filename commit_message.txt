Ramin Yazdani | molformer-finetuning-property-prediction | main | feat(setup): Add requirements.txt with core ML dependencies

Added Python dependency specifications for the project including PyTorch, Transformers,
Datasets, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and jupyter. These dependencies form the foundation
for molecular property prediction using chemical language models.

Dependencies chosen:
- torch>=2.0.0: Core deep learning framework
- transformers>=4.30.0: HuggingFace models including MolFormer
- datasets>=2.12.0: Dataset loading and processing
- pandas, numpy: Data manipulation
- scikit-learn: ML utilities and metrics
- jupyter: Interactive development

Verification: requirements.txt created with 7 core dependencies.
