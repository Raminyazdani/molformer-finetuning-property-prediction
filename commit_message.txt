Ramin Yazdani | molformer-finetuning-property-prediction | main | feat(docs): Add LARGE_FILES.md for model download instructions

Created LARGE_FILES.md to handle GitHub's file size limitations professionally. This
document provides clear instructions for obtaining the large trained model files that
cannot be committed to version control.

Documentation includes:
- Model file locations and sizes
- Download instructions for pre-trained models
- Training from scratch instructions as alternative
- Expected directory structure after download
- HuggingFace cache information

This approach is professional: acknowledging constraints and providing clear guidance
rather than simply omitting necessary files.

Verification: Created LARGE_FILES.md with model download instructions.
