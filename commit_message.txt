Ramin Yazdani | molformer-finetuning-property-prediction | main | WIP(docs): Update README with repository structure

Added "Repository Structure" section to README documenting the purpose of each directory
and the overall project organization. This helps new users understand where to find files
and where to place generated outputs.

Documentation includes:
- Directory tree visualization
- Purpose description for each folder
- File type expectations

This documentation is added while the structure is fresh in mind, before adding actual
content to these directories.

Verification: README.md updated with structure section.
