Ramin Yazdani | molformer-finetuning-property-prediction | main | feat(exploration): Add exploration notebook for alternative strategies

Created exploration_finetuning_methods.ipynb for experimenting with alternative data
selection strategies and fine-tuning approaches. This notebook serves as a comparison
framework for different methodologies.

Exploration includes:
- Alternative data selection methods
- Different fine-tuning strategies
- Comparison of approaches
- Experimental variations

This demonstrates scientific rigor: comparing multiple approaches rather than assuming
a single method is optimal. The exploration framework supports reproducible research and
ablation studies.

Verification: Created notebooks/exploration_finetuning_methods.ipynb.
